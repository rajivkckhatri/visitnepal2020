                    <p>Pokhara is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Nepal. Many tourists visit Pokhara Valley to see the Himalayan range and lakes. Pokhara is also famous for boating, trekking, rafting, and extreme sports like rafting, canoeing, and bungee jumping. Typical Nepal travels provides excellent services and very helpful during overall tour. I and my family enjoyed a lot and adventure a lot we will plan to go to Nepal again...</p>

                    <p>Whirlwind tour of Nepal and India. Well organized and great guides in both countries. Very comfortable hotels. Would suggest maybe a bit more free time and longer in each place. Either visiting fewer places or making tournaments longer. Citrus was very good. Kept us informed all along the way. I will use again.</p>

                    <p>We have just returned from Nepal and the golden triangle holiday that you arranged for us. I just wanted to say what an amazing time we had. The guides, accommodation, trips, etc were just fantastic. What great value for money this holiday was. We felt supported by your staff etc for the whole holiday. And both drivers were very careful and took no chances. They also were amazing. The highlight was the Everest flight you organized for us. 

Thank you again</p>
